        <img class="imgr borderedbox" src="images1/logo.jpg" alt="">
        <p><font color="black">The Hindu College along with Hindu Sabha Senior Secondary School and Hindu Sabha Sanskrit College Amritsar is run by the Hindu Sabha(Regd.),Amritsar,a body of philanthropists aiming at:</font></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Promoting and Propagating lofty ideas and ideals among the youth of the nation.</li>
            <li>Providing the younger generation with opportunities to acquire knowledge of siences,humanities,commerce,computer science and information technology.</li>
            <li>Producing healthy,intelligent,worthy and useful citizens.</li>
        </ol>
          
          <p><font color="black">The Hindu College, Amritsar was founded in 1924 in order to meet the growing demand for university education in the town,which was serve at that time by only a single institution situated at a distance of four miles from the heart of the city.Feeling the urgent need of an institution which should be more centrally located and be able to serve all the sections of the local comunity without the distinctions of caste or creed,eminent leaders like late Sir Gopal Dass Bhndhari and other illutrious philanthropists decided in 1924 to raise the existing Hindu Sabha High Schoolto the level of an intermediate College.This status continued for twelve years until 1936 when degree classes were added and the College began to impart education in all important subjects for the intermediate and Degree classes.During the last 88 years,the seed sown by the early founders of the College hs grown into a mighty blossoming tree and the citizens of Amritsar can take legitimate pride in the meritorious service rendered by the institution in the field of education and culture.The College is now running five Post Graduate courses. </font></p>
          <p><font color="black">During its long and brilliant history, the Hindu College has carved traditions, the most important of which is the emphasis on the balanced and harmonious development of each and every student's personality. The battle of the life demands from the individual not only the expression of one's intellectual skills, but also of those concerning the physical,mental, emotional and social aspects of his personality make-up. It is this creed which led the College up the ladder of growth and progress in the past and it is this philosophy which keeps inspiring it in its present and future endeavours. Dr. Manmohan Singh, Hon'ble Ex. Prime Minister of India, Field Marshal S. F. H. J. Manekshaw, Justice H. R. Khanna, Former Union Cabinet Minister for Law and Justice, padam Vibhushan Sh. Maharaj Krishan Rasgotra, Former Indian  Foreign Secretary, Lt. Gen.(Retd.) B.K.N. Chhiber, Ex. Governer, Punjab are only a few after long list  of prominent personalities who can greatfully look back to this institution where theyvwere nurtured and groomed.</font></p>

Our teams annexed First positions(Phototgraphy, Peotical Recitation), Second positions(Poster Making &Quiz), Third Positions(Indian Group Shabad, Clay Modelling, Still Painting, Rangoli and College)in the various competitions held by GNDU.</font></p>
