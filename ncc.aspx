        <p > <font color="black" >National Cadet Corps is a Tri-Services Organization , comprising the Army, Navy and Air Force, engaged in grooming the youth of the country into disciplined and patriotic citizens. In 1920 when the Indian Territorial Act was passed the 'University Corps' was replaced by University Training Corps (UTC). In 1942 the UTC was re-christened as the 'University Officers Training Corps'. The National Cadet Corps came into existence on 15 th July 1948 under the NCC Act XXXI of 1948 under the Ministry of Defence. The origin of NCC can be traced back to the ' University Corps' , which was created under the Indian Defence Act 1917, with the object to make up the shortage of the defence services.</font></p>
